       "'SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEMBATTLED. Dismissed Bamban, Tarlac mayor Alice Guo attends the Senate public hearing on human trafficking, cyber crimes and other related abuses in connection with POGO operations, on September 9, 2024.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAngie de Silva/Rappler\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t The Supreme Court (SC) has dismissed the petition filed by former Bamban, Tarlac mayor  Alice Guo  against the Senate subpoena that required her to appear during the chamber’s months-long probe into Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs). “The Supreme Court (SC) has upheld the subpoena issued by the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality (Committee) requiring former Bamban Mayor Alice Guo (Guo) to testify in its investigation,” the SC said on Friday, August 15. The SC en banc voted to deny Guo’s petition, discussed the merits of the case, and did not declare the petition moot and academic. The Senate has already wrapped up its probe into the issue and the 19th Congress had already adjourned. Associate Justice Japar Dimaampao wrote the decision.  Guo, in July 2024,  filed her petition with the SC  after she was subpoenaed by Senate women committee chairperson Senator Risa Hontiveros for skipping a hearing. Later, Guo was cited in contempt by the panel for her continued absence. The former mayor claimed that the Senate panel violated her constitutional rights, her right to due process, and her right to privacy. In the ruling, the High Court said it followed the 1987 Constitution and the Senate Rules of Procedure in Guo’s case. The SC said the former mayor’s rights were not violated and that the probe was “a legitimate exercise of legislative\\xa0power aimed at protecting the public interest and upholding the law.” A point of contention in the case was the Senate’s power to hold investigations, including its probe into the abuses and crimes surrounding POGOs. The SC reiterated that under Article VI, Section 21 of the Constitution, the upper chamber and its committees can conduct probes in aid of legislation. The Senate, according to the High Court, may do this as long as it follows the available rules and respects the rights of the people involved. “The SC found that the Committee’s investigation into illegal POGO\\xa0operations in Bamban, Tarlac, was within its authority. The questions asked about Guo’s identity, family, relationships, assets, and businesses were relevant and\\xa0necessary to the inquiry,” the High Court said. According to the SC, the issuance of the subpoena and related actions were within Senate rules. It was also found that Guo “retained her right against self-incrimination, which she chose not to exercise.” “This ruling strengthens the Senate’s ability to uncover the truth in matters of urgent public interest, such as the infiltration of illegal POGO operations and the alarming allegations surrounding former Bamban Mayor Guo Hua Ping, alias ‘Alice Guo’,” Hontiveros said in a statement. “The decision reaffirms what the Constitution clearly provides: that legislative inquiries in aid of legislation—when conducted under our established rules—are a vital tool for accountability and the creation of policies which protect public interest and guard our nation’s sovereignty,” she added.  Apart from the legitimacy of the probe, Guo also challenged the contempt against her.  During its probes, the Senate and the House of Representatives may cite persons in contempt and detain them if they snub hearings or are uncooperative during inquiries, just like what happened to Guo.  A person held in contempt may be held under custody “until he/she agrees to produce the required documents, or to be sworn or to testify, or otherwise purge himself/herself of that contempt.” “Regarding contempt, the Committee cited Guo for leaving the Philippines\\xa0despite notice of the next hearing, and for refusing to answer even basic questions\\xa0during one of the hearings she attended. The SC affirmed that citing individuals\\xa0for contempt is part of the Senate’s legislative powers,” the High Court said. In previous decisions, the SC  said \\xa0that the Senate can detain a person held in contempt for only as long as the inquiry was ongoing. Guo also raised the issue of privacy. The SC said public officials have limited expectation of privacy when their acts involve official functions or matters of national interest.  “Documents such as Guo’s birth certificate, SALNs (Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth), and business\\xa0records were essential to the investigation and thus lawfully disclosed, even under\\xa0the Data Privacy Act of 2012,” the SC explained.  In the ruling, the SC also reiterated that in legislative probes, there are two key safeguards: one, the chambers must follow their published rules of procedure, and two, the chambers must respect the Bill of Rights. “The SC clarified that the purpose of a legislative inquiry is not to find guilt,\\xa0but to ensure effective legislation,” it added.  Guo is currently detained due to multiple cases, including  trafficking  and  money laundering  over her alleged ties to an anomalous POGO in her town. Back in June, a local court  ruled  that Guo is “undoubtedly Chinese,” and erased her mayorship from the records, saying she was never qualified to begin with. –  Rappler.com \\xa0 How does this make you feel?
