       "'SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. MANILA, Philippines – Google announced on Monday, July 21, it removed nearly 11,000 YouTube channels and other accounts in the second quarter of 2025 for “coordinated influence operation campaigns” on the service. In  a bulletin post for Q2 2025 , it listed some 7,700 channels linked to Chinese propaganda.  These included the termination of 1,545 YouTube channels in April, 3,592 YouTube channels in May, and 2,598 YouTube channels and the blockage of one domain from eligibility to appear on Google News surfaces and Discover in June.  “The coordinated inauthentic network uploaded content in Chinese and English about China and US foreign affairs,” the post said. Meanwhile, more than 2,000 YouTube channels were removed in Q2 2025 for “coordinated influence operations linked to Russia.” These included content in multiple languages showing support for Russia and criticism for Ukraine, Poland, NATO, and the West. In May, the company also removed 20 YouTube channels, 4 Ads accounts, and 1 Blogger blog linked to Russian influence ops. In this case, the campaign was “linked to the  Russian state-controlled media outlet RT  and was sharing content in Spanish, English, Serbian, and Russian that was supportive of Russia and critical of Ukraine and the West.” Other removed influence campaigns were linked to Azerbaijan, Iran, Israel, Ghana, Romania, and Turkey and appeared to target political rivals or, as in Israel’s case here, to posit support for Israel and criticize Palestine. Google’s Threat Analysis Group removed more than 23,000 accounts in the first quarter of 2025, most notably more than 11,900 China-linked YouTube channels which discussed Chinese and US foreign affairs.  – Rappler.com How does this make you feel?
